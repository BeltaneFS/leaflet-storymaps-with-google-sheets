About this project,,,,"Dear Beltane is a project born out of a yearning for the sharing of stories and memories that is so much part of the Beltane Fire Festival. While we can’t share these stories in person, taking time to sit down and write them out offers a different kind of connection. Writing a physical letter in today’s world, dominated by electronic communication, makes it a physical manifestation of care, and to find one in your letterbox or by your door breaks up the monotony of days spent in lockdown. With this project we hope to restore a sense of physicality, community and history, to celebrate the places that are important to us, and each other.
Now the results of it are displayed in two ways: A digital exhibition to scroll and explore, and a physical map embroidered with all the spots marked by participants, to be kept in the BFS archives.

It left me content and connected. In the intervening years I have been observing the pagan feasts, discovering my connection to our earth, our seasons and ‘our’ people. I’m a trained celebrant and often help people reconnect to their lost loved ones in ritual and story. <br>

The first time I ever went up Calton Hill was after dark, for Beltane 2014, and it permanently disoriented me. Whether in light or darkness, I have never quite managed to orient myself on that one of Edinburgh’s hills, despite a generally quite good sense of direction. I cherish that disorientation.<br>
I’m not really a concert person, but I think I experienced that night what people love about them - the shifting animal of the crowd, the fluid boundary between performance and genuine experience (not, of course, to say that performance isn’t genuine experience). I lost myself there in a way I almost ever have, and I think about that all the time.,<br>

Child: (Screams!)<br>
Parent: What!<br>
Child: Mum! Death eaters!<br>
Parent: Don't be silly, Death eaters don't...<br>
[Child pulls Parent's arm, turning her round to see procession of cloaked and painted torchies]<br>
Parent: (Screams!)<br><br>
2) On the Acropolis<br>
Groups of three or four torchbearers in the dark gaps between the pillars. The wind at our backs, the rustle and hub-bub of the crowd below us in front, almost invisible behind the sea of camera flashes. The neidfire bearers pass along the step beneath us, lighting one torch in each group so that we can light each other. As they return to the central gap, the processional drummers step out and form up in front of the right hand torchies. Suddenly, it gets a lot brighter and there's a disturbance amongst the neighbouring torchbearers. I can feel my back getting increasibly hot and see small golden sparks blowing through the smoke, fading to red and disappearing. It was only the fire sculptures behind us. Panic over, we relax and prepare to follow the drums.<br><br>
3) And they're off!<br>
[actually a walkthrough memory]<br>
Following the processionals, almost at the double, we interleave with the stewards and fall in beside the Whites as we leave the D. Suddenly, overcome by the sheer joy of the walkthrough on such a glorious afternoon, I break character and say (a little louder than I intended) ""And as they come up to the first turn, it's May Queen in the lead, May Queen followed by Green Man. May Queen, Green Man, Blue Man coming up the outside...."" I'm not sure if the facepaint quite cracked, but I got A Look from the White to my left.<br><br>
4) Autopilot<br>
[A NON-memory]<br>
It's possible, though, to over practice. One year I remember stepping off the Acropolis and falling into place in the procession - and then nothing at all until entering the Bower.<br><br>
5) Bower bits<br>
(not all the same year)<br>
Standing under a tree by the Bower, not realising that there were audience members above me until I heard the stewards coax them down.<br>
Again by the Bower, a hand appears in front of my face from behind and pops a chocolate-coated strawberry into my mouth. It was delicious, so sweet and so cold.<br>
Bad weather years - Torches are really useful for warming performers whose costumes are mostly paint<br><br>
6) The Fire<br>
[Depending on when we stand down, we'd not always make it to the Fire, but it was always special when we did]<br>As we made our way from Acropolis to Bower for Beltane 2010, with the Moon just past full, we could hear comments from the crowd to our sides or behind us - not just the usual telling / re-invention of the Beltane story, but something  far stranger. Something about a penguin on the Hill? Surely not. And then, when we finally got to the Fire, there it was. An enormous penguin. Or more precisely, someone in a penguin onesie....<br>

Hello Dear Beltane!<br>
I have to be honest, choosing a single memory was at time tricky, but I got there eventually :) <br>
For me, the Beltane Fire Festival of 2015 was every bit of a transformative journey. Even though I was on my third festival overall, I started out still feeling relatively new to it all. By the last fortnight of prep though, I felt well and truly home. Came April 30th, things just fell into place with ease. Two months of prep with Photo Point had paid off beautifully. In the 6 years that have followed, I feel like I’ve prospered more than well here in BFS!<br>

Anticipation,media/19back.jpg,,,"In our last practise as Whites in 2019, we rehearsed our procession one last time, from beginning to end without stopping or speaking. The hill was thick with fog, with only a few other people on it. They would have seen us performing a silent, precise ritual around the hill: 19 people in white jumpers or shirts, moving in unison, without music or audience, stopping to encircle & honour empty patches of grass. Only we knew what we were celebrating, and we did it with grace, love, and certainty. It was one of the most lovely things I have done.<br>

My favourite was Beltane 2019 as a beastie. We watched the sunset then headed over to our starting point and got into a cuddle puddle where we lie covered in cloaks. We were lying there for a long time that year and I was so cosy and warm and calm that I actually fell asleep for about 10-15 minutes only waking up when fire cans were lit by tech (after neid fire) and the call horn sounded. I fell asleep as myself + woke up a Beastie.<br>

I stood with my sisters and brothers; white-clad warriors there to protect and share the joy of a new spring with our Queen. I had felt my sense of self slowly drifting to sleep on the procession across Holyrood Green, through the town, and up the hill, to this point, in a still and tense limbo, in the shadow of the Folly’s columns. I had felt my White - this stoic warrior that had always felt a little bit like a pretence, - come closer and closer, until that moment. It took so long for things on the other side from us to happen. We stood there, four handmaidens, around the May Queen, and I felt like iron, like stone, like an immovable object, devoted to my Goddess, but there was still a part of me that felt as I always had - uncertain, afraid, elated, bubbling over with anticipation, and terrified that my body would fail me, collapse underneath me, fall off that high stone monument, and whatever else I could picture. <br>And I said to myself, in a scared voice: “My legs hurt… what if I fall?” <br>And a voice answered back: “Then we will use my legs.” <br>And it was like that last part of me that was fragile, and afraid, fell asleep. And my White held me, safe in the back of my mind, while she strode forth, and protected, and fought, and fell in love, and gave me a Spring to wake up in.",18,Plain,17_gold,,55.95467936,-3.181834526,,,,

Fire Arch,media/Fire Arch_Bartlomiej Pyrz.jpg,Bartlomiej Pryz for Beltane Fire Society,,"Dear Beltane, <br>
If I had to pick a spot to encapsulate my personal Beltane story… it would be Fire Arch.<br>
When I first stumbled upon Beltane 2015 as a witness, I didn’t know what to expect. Squinting at a map I got from the entrance, I realized my group wouldn’t make it to the Acropolis in time. So instead we tried to get ahead to intercept the procession at the Fire Arch. After hearing but not seeing the Acropolis drumming and the lighting of the Neid Fires, we waited for the procession. Somehow, we ended up front row right after the May Queen and Whites passed through the Arch, keening with all their hearts. I suddenly felt like I was alone witnessing this outpouring of grief and emotion instead of in a crowd. The rest of that amazing night passed in a blur because I was so affected by it.<br>
I joined Beltane the next year and joined Fire Arch as a fire-spinner. We made a small, tight group of spinners and I got to try so many brand new skills – fire, acro, character work. My memorable moment of that festival was making a pyramid under the arch as it lit up – only to realise when the pyrotechnics went off that we were getting showered with ash and yet had to stay stoic! That was the final year of the “old” Fire Arch Design, as it lasted just about until the procession made it through then warped so much from use that it couldn’t be safely reassembled! That year the Arch only stayed up because of the hopes and dreams and hard sweat of Tech.<br>
The year after, in 2017, I felt ready and called to join the Whites. Now I was one of those powerful, beautiful beings that keened out as they passed through the Arch. I hadn’t realised the full significance as a witness but now I learned about holding the grief of a community and showing it by keening for those who couldn’t express it themselves. The next year I was one of the White GOs, at the head of the procession keening once more. This time I shrieked with all of my soul, tears were welling up in my eyes. I felt like I was being gutted but I also felt the incredible space that we were creating and holding for those in the area. It’s truly a magical spot. No matter what I do in Beltane or how many other special places there are… for me, Fire Arch is truly the place where I feel closest to the Beltane Festival.<br>

My memory is a short one, all about 'Pleasure', which as we all know is from the bass. <br>
It was 2018, after hanging up my Event Coordinator hard hat, I'd become a Beastie.
